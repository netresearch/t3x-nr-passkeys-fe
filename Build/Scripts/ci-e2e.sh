# CI wrapper for `runTests.sh -s e2e`.
#
# The reusable workflow netresearch/typo3-ci-workflows/.github/workflows/e2e.yml
# calls this with `setup-script: Build/Scripts/ci-e2e.sh` and no arguments. In
# that mode the script owns the whole pipeline, which here means handing over to
# the shared runner: it installs the composer dependencies, builds a TYPO3
# instance from the e2e_provision_* hooks in Build/Scripts/runTests.conf, brings
# up MariaDB, PHP-FPM and Apache, and drives Playwright against them.
#
# Environment the workflow provides: E2E_TYPO3_VERSION, E2E_VARIANT,
# E2E_TYPO3_PACKAGES and COMPOSER_RETRY. The first two are read by the shared
# provisioner, COMPOSER_RETRY is passed into the provisioning container by it,
# so this script only has to keep them exported.
#
# Local invocation calls the runner directly and needs no wrapper:
#   E2E_TYPO3_VERSION=14 ./Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s e2e
